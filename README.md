# 15Puzzle
 15 Puzzle Game. This fun app demonstrates the following Android core functionalities. There are some limitations that I'm still trying to work out.
 
 * MVVM 
 * Data binding
 * Networking using okHttp
 * BindingAdapters
 * Kotlin coroutines

# Limitations: 
 * The grid that shows the shuffled image chunks are cut off on the right. 
 * There is no way for the app to know when the puzzle has been "solved". Presumably as easy as making sure the grid indexes are sorted.
 * There is no way to reset to original image.
